# ERP_Application_Project
Designed a database in PostgreSQL and created an ERP application with a user interface in Python.

The database has been created based on an ER-model uploaded as an image. 11 tables have been created, recording login credentials and time in the application, employees and customers information, inventory, models, sale orders, among other things. Several users with different privileges depending on their job have been defined (ex: engineer, sales, hr, admin). Views are created for business reports.

The ERP application allows to track sales, employee salaries and benefits, inventory and run reports, depending on the username and password you enter.
